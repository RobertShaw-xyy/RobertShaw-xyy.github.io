## Research Experience
#### Detection and Classification of Surface Defects of Metal Mechanical Parts Based on Deep Learning	07/2021-02/2022

1. Collected metal surface images by CCD line scan camera and designed algorithms for metal surface defect detection and preprocessing based on OpenCV.
2. Improved the network structure based on YOLOv3 and combined the shallow output of DarkNET-53 with the deep output of the network to add a new scale feature layer, solving the problem of insensitive detection of small targets on the original network.
3. Adjusted the parameters and used K-Means++ clustering method to enhance the accuracy of target location prediction and detection effect of the model according to the Distance-IoU ratio
Trained the model and continued adjusting various parameters to optimize the model.
4. Tested five surface defects of metal mechanical parts including pits, patches, cracks, gaps and scratches based on the improved YOLOv3 network structure, indicating that its mAP is improved by about 2.09%~7.68% compared to the unimproved method.

#### Focusing Simulation of Ultra-chaotic Image with Fuzzy Feature Based on Visual Characteristics	06/2020-01/2021

1. Built a visual characteristic model based on various related functions like visual fovea characteristic function, etc.
2. Added an enhancement factor for the membership function to ensure the core texture features of the image and improve the contrast of different gray-level areas.
Realized first quick focusing by improving the variance function and identifying the sharpness of the hyperchaotic image and secondary accurate focusing through the improved Robert gradient threshold method.
3. Used MATLAB to test the final anti-noise property, and found that the anti-noise rate was increased by about 30% compared with the traditional method and the focusing time was shortened by nearly 20% compared with the previous method.
